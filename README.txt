#Royal Holloway University of London Final Year Project

This was my final year project for my BSc in Computer Science which achieved a first.

I developed a game which demonstrates various search alogrithms and scored these algorithms based on efficiency (Least amount of steps taken to reach the goal).

Check out my final report ([here](RHUL-FYP/LeonardoDaSilva.Final.pdf))

To play the game just open the "Maze Game Project" application inside the GAME folder and it will run itself.

Press quit in the main menu, during simulation or ALT + F4 to close the game

I have included the scripts for the files I edited myself. The player mode was not implemented as I didn't have enough time, 
that goes the same for the minimax algorithm for all the sizes in single and multi agents.
